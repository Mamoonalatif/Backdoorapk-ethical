# Mobile Security Lab – Insider Threat Simulation

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **research report** on a controlled lab exercise simulating a mobile insider threat scenario.  
The project demonstrates how Android applications can be reverse-engineered and repackaged to include malicious payloads in order to raise **awareness of risks** and propose **defensive countermeasures**.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
- All activities were conducted in a controlled lab environment with explicit authorization.  
- No malicious APKs or exploit code are included.  
- This repo is for **educational and defensive cybersecurity awareness only**.  

## 🔑 Key Learnings
- Mobile app reverse engineering with APKTool.  
- Payload injection simulation using penetration testing frameworks.  
- Reverse shell awareness and insider threat risks.  
- Recommendations for mobile app hardening and user awareness.
